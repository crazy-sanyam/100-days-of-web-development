    Saikhom Mirabai Chanu was born on 8 August 1994 in Nongpok Kakching[6] about 30 Km away from Imphal city, Manipur[7]
    to a Meitei family. Her family identified her strength when she was just 12. She could easily carry a huge bundle of
    firewood home when her elder brother found it hard to even pick it up.[8]
