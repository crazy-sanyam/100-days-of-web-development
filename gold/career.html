<h1>2016 Junior World Champion and Army induction</h1>
<p id="p1">General Bipin Rawat, Chief of Army Staff, congratulating Chopra, gold medallist in javelin throw, and Gaurav Solanki, gold medallist in boxing, for their performance in the 2018 Commonwealth Games. Chopra won a gold medal in the 2016 IAAF World U20 Championships
    in Bydgoszcz, Poland and set a world junior record of 86.48 m. He however failed to qualify for the 2016 Summer Olympics as the cut-off date had been 11 July, the week before the U20 championships. Impressed with Chopra's performance at the South
    Asian Games and his future potential, the Indian Army offered him a direct appointment as a Junior Commissioned Officer in the Rajputana Rifles with the rank of Naib Subedar, a rank typically not immediately granted to athletes, who are usually recruited
    as non-commissioned officers (NCO).In September 2016, he left the NIS Patiala to train at the Sports Authority of India centre in Bengaluru.He was formally inducted as a JCO in December 2016, and subsequently received leave to continue his training.

<h1> 2017–2021</h1>
<p id="p2"> Chopra won a gold medal in the 2017 Asian Athletics Championships in Bhubaneshwar, Odisha. Chopra won gold in the 2017 Asian Athletics Championships with a throw of 85.23 metres.In the men's javelin throw at 2018 Commonwealth Games, he registered a season-best
    effort of 86.47 metres, becoming one of the few Indian athletes to win a gold medal on their Commonwealth Games debut, also becoming the first Indian to win the javelin throw at the Games.In May 2018, he again broke the national record at the Doha
    Diamond League with a throw of 87.43 metres.In August 2018, Chopra made his debut appearance at the Asian Games representing India at the 2018 Asian Games, and was also the flag-bearer for the Indian contingent during the 2018 Asian Games Parade of
    Nations.On 27 August, he threw a distance of 88.06 m to win gold in the Men's javelin throw at the 2018 Asian Games and set a new Indian national record, bettering his own previous record.It was also India's first gold medal in javelin throw at the
    Asian Games. Chopra was the only track and field athlete that year to be recommended by the AFI for the country's highest sports award, the Khel Ratna, but was awarded the Arjuna Award in September 2018.Having suffered an elbow injury, Chopra underwent
    surgery in Mumbai on 2 May 2019, the day after the qualifying competitions for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics had begun. After a period of recuperation, involving meditation and rehabilitative training at Patiala and the IIS Vijayanagar, Chopra travelled
    to South Africa in November 2019 for training under German biomechanics expert Klaus Bartoneitz.Previously, he had been coached by Gary Calvert,Werner Daniels and Uwe Hohn. After a 16-month hiatus, he returned to international competition in January
    2020 with a winning throw of 87.86 metres in the Athletics Central North West League Meeting in Potchefstroom, South Africa, which qualified him for Tokyo. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Chopra spent the next year in India training at the NIS Patiala.On
    5 March 2021, Chopra again broke his own national record with a new throw of 88.07m, establishing him in a world leading position. After weeks of attempting to secure a travel visa, which Chopra described as frustrating, he was cleared to travel to
    France with his coach.He opened his international season of 2021 with a throw of 83.18 metres that earned him a gold medal at an event in Lisbon, Portugal,but skipped the World Athletics Continental Tour and the Diamond League event at Gateshead to
    rest and prepare for the Olympics.

<h1>2020 Tokyo Olympics </h1>
<p id="p3">
    Summer Olympics – Men's javelin throw Chopra made his debut at the Olympics representing India at the 2020 Summer Olympics.On 4 August 2021, he was placed in Group A. Despite the effects of jet lag after flying to Tokyo from Sweden and a disrupted sleep
    schedule due to regular dope-control testing, Chopra topped his group and qualified for the final in the men's javelin throw with a throw of 86.65 metres.Competing with more-experienced and better-performing athletes, notably Johannes Vetter of Germany,
    Chopra's strategy for the final, which he developed with his coach Bartonietz, was to rely on his speed and put pressure on the rest of the field with a powerful long throw. As a result, Chopra won the gold medal in the final on 7 August with a throw
    of 87.58 m,and became the first Indian Olympian to win a gold medal in athletics, and the first post-independence Indian Olympic medalist in athletics. He also became the second Indian to win an individual Olympic gold medal after Abhinav Bindra,
    who won the gold medal in the men's 10 m air rifle in the 2008 Summer Olympics. Chopra dedicated his win to sprinters Milkha Singh and P. T. Usha.
