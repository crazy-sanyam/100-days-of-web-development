    <p>A strong personality and a successful general, Akbar gradually enlarged the Mughal Empire to include much of the
        Indian subcontinent. His power and influence, however, extended over the entire subcontinent because of Mughal
        military, political, cultural, and economic dominance. To unify the vast Mughal state, Akbar established a
        centralised system of administration throughout his empire and adopted a policy of conciliating conquered rulers
        through marriage and diplomacy. To preserve peace and order in a religiously and culturally diverse empire, he
        adopted policies that won him the support of his non-Muslim subjects. Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic state
        identity, Akbar strove to unite far-flung lands of his realm through loyalty, expressed through an Indo-Persian
        culture, to himself as an emperor.</p>
